Several Dutch lawmakers on Tuesday challenged the Netherlands' Trade Minister over whether the U.S. has acted correctly in unilaterally imposing new rules regulating the export to China of another chipmaking machine made by ASML Holding. Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher said during a parliamentary debate the Cabinet was not opposed to the new U.S. rules affecting Europe's largest tech firm but "this should be tackled in a much more European way."
