Taiwan Vice President Lai Ching-te on Tuesday lambasted China over its probe of major Apple [(AAPL.O)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn [(2317.TW)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/2317.TW), saying Beijing should "cherish" Taiwanese companies and not put pressure on them during an election.

Lai is the frontrunner, according to polls, to win January's presidential election.
