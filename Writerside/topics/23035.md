Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday said it is gratifying that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has [submitted](https://www.reuters.com/world/turkeys-erdogan-submits-swedens-nato-bid-parliament-ratification-presidency-2023-10-23/) a bill approving the Nordic country's NATO membership bid to Turkey's parliament for ratification.

Sweden applied last year to join the defence alliance but Turkey and Hungary have yet to approve the bid.
