Hamas released two elderly hostages on Monday, bringing the total to four. The Palestinian militant organization announced the release of Nurit Cooper and Yochved Lifshitz, and the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed the news.

Their transfer follows the Friday release of two American hostages. It's been more than two weeks since Hamas launched its assault on Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages.

Health authorities in Gaza said [over 5,000 people have been killed](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/23/israel-hamas-war-updates-and-latest-news-on-gaza-conflict.html#107321468-uFPc3G8nV) since the Oct. 7 start of the war between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel. More than 15,000 have been injured, the authorities said.

CNBC could not independently verify these numbers.

The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that its soldiers were conducting a "variety of training exercises in order to improve the forces' readiness and capabilities for ground operations in the Gaza Strip."

Still, a full surrender of Hamas and the return of Israeli hostages [could end Israel's war](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/23/israel-hamas-war-updates-and-latest-news-on-gaza-conflict.html#107321381-JmLHHjT3c) in the Gaza Strip, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told ABC Radio Melbourne.

A senior U.S. defense official said the military is monitoring escalating threats of violence, but declined to say whether Iran or other proxy groups plan to intensify attacks on U.S. troops, NBC News reported.

"We know there is a significant threat of escalation throughout the region," including to U.S. troops, the official said. They added that an uptick in violence in the region has "Iranian fingerprints all over it."

"We see a prospect for much more significant escalation against U.S. forces and personnel in the near term," the official said. "Let's be clear about it, all roads lead back to Iran."

U.S. troops were deployed to Syria and Iraq "for one purpose and one purpose only," they added. "It's to support local partners who are in the lead to achieve the enduring defeat of ISIS."

"What Iran is actually doing is giving space for ISIS to reconstitute and further destabilize the region," the official said.

The Pentagon on Monday afternoon laid out the U.S. firepower that has been repositioned in an effort to mitigate the expansion of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered the movement of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf.

"Our carrier strike groups give us the ability to launch operations independently, anywhere in the world and immediately upon arrival," a senior Defense official told reporters on the call.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules established by the Pentagon, added that the Defense Department has placed additional forces on prepare-to-deploy orders in order to "increase their readiness and ensure rapid response."

The United Nations Security Council will meet Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET to discuss the security situation in Gaza.

The meeting comes as the first convoys of critical humanitarian aid arrive in Gaza.

Last week, the United States vetoed a resolution on humanitarian assistance in Gaza because it failed to "mention Israel's right of self-defense" in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack carried out by Hamas.

"Russia's resolution, put forward without any consultations, makes no mention of Hamas — none. By failing to condemn Hamas, Russia is giving cover to a terrorist group that brutalizes innocent civilians.

Hamas said it has released two hostages, identified as Nurit Cooper and Yochved Lifshitz, for "compelling humanitarian" reasons.

The militant group said on its [Telegram channel](https://t.me/spokesman_2020/54) that the release was brokered through the governments of Egypt and Qatar. Hamas is estimated to have taken approximately 222 hostages.

The family of Lifshitz, 85, confirmed to NBC News the hostage release.

Though Hamas previously said it tried to release the two hostages on Friday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it "propaganda," and Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed skepticism that they would be released.

Earlier in the day, the State Department declined to discuss U.S. and partner efforts to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas more than two weeks ago.

"We do want to see all of the hostages released and we want to see them released unconditionally and we want to see them released as soon as possible," State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters during a daily press briefing.

The planes will fly to Egypt, from which point the goods will be sent to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing.

Koca added that the aircrafts will deliver medical equipment and supplies, medication and generators — a critical component, as Gaza authorities say the local health system is collapsing amid shortages of electricity and fuel.

"We are happy to fulfill this responsibility on behalf of our nation. Our humanitarian responsibility does not end here. There is more," Koca said.

Since the weekend, convoys carrying U.N.-brokered humanitarian aid have begun to reach the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, but human rights groups signal that the number of trucks and deliveries is insufficient to meet local needs.

Gaza says more than 5,000 people killed
---------------------------------------

Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza said over 5,000 people were killed since the Oct. 7 start of the war between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel.

The figures, [released by Health Ministry spokesperson Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra](https://www.facebook.com/MOHGaza1994/posts/pfbid0TpwUSiLiPauwJ5ibej3sMGYQFwuW1xbQtLya3TZH7GnQGC7GBCt3WvMs7Rf1waQkl), include 2,055 children. Some 15,273 people remain injured.

The enclosure has been under perpetual bombardment from Israeli forces, which are pursuing the forces of Hamas, following the Palestinian militant group's multi-pronged terror attacks of early October. Israel has sealed off the Gaza Strip, depriving it of its water, fuel, food and electricity resources, and these shortages — combined with the absence of medical equipment — are bringing the Gaza health system near collapse, human rights group and the Palestinian health ministry have previously said.

At least 1,400 Israeli people have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to official figures out Friday. Roughly 222 hostages remain abducted by Hamas in Gaza, Israeli military says.

Gaza Strip urgently needs fuel, UN relief agency says
-----------------------------------------------------

The blockaded Gaza Strip needs fuel supplies as urgently as it does water and food resources, an official for the U.N. Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said Monday.

"No fuel has come into Gaza for the last two weeks," UNRWA Director of External Relations Tamara Alrifai [told CNN in a TV interview](https://twitter.com/UNRWA/status/1716357755840159939), "And without fuel, it's not going to be possible to go around Gaza in our trucks and distribute assistance or to power the water desalination plants and get clean drinking water or to power hospitals and their live-saving machines."

She added that the convoys of humanitarian aid that have entered the Gaza Strip since the weekend represent a "trickle" of the volume of supplies needed to support the civilian population of the region.

"These trucks really only contain a fraction of what is needed, given the immense, immense humanitarian needs," she said, noting that the Gaza Strip previously received roughly 100 trucks of humanitarian aid and fuel per day.

Israel cut off its own deliveries of water, fuel, food and electricity to the Gaza Strip and refuses to reinstate them, on the premise that they would support the forces of Palestinian militant group Hamas stationed within the territory.

Israel-Hamas war: More 'sophisticated' approach to Hamas needed, analyst says

[Street Signs Europe](https://www.cnbc.com/street-signs-europe/)

Current aid supplies to Gaza are "drop in the ocean" that will have little substantial impact, Chatham House associate fellow Yossi Mekelberg said Monday.

"Some humanitarian help is better than none, but this is a drop in the ocean. Twenty to 40 trucks \[or\] lorries won't make a huge difference, you need at least 100 a day," he told CNBC after the first aid convoys entered the embattled territory over the weekend.

Noting that the conflict is unlikely to be resolved within the coming days or weeks, Mekelberg advised that new political thinking would likely be needed to reach a solution that is agreeable to both sides.

"You need new leadership in both political entities. You need people to think about peaceful coexistence — a two-state solution in a one-state reality," he said.

"You need innovative and creative ideas and you need a new generation that understands that violence will just breed more violence and bloodshed and won't improve the lives of either side one iota."

An Israeli ground offensive into Gaza is unlikely for the next 72 hours: Analyst

[Squawk Box Europe](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-europe/)

A ground incursion by Israel into Gaza is unlikely over the next 48 to 72 hours or possibly even the rest of the week, according to one analyst. While it appears to be inevitable — the bigger question might be what comes next.

Samuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday that it is "very, very hard" to understand what could happen if and when Israel achieves its immediate strategy of destroying Hamas.

Asked whether there is a danger that Israel may end up in a position that it can't then get out of, Ramani replied, "That's actually what some of the Israeli officials have even been saying, you know, off the record and privately to various media outlets: We don't really know what will happen next."

Ramani added, "It is very, very hard to understand what will happen once Hamas goes, and the risk is that many civilians die in this war, Hamas could be going underground, or new extremist movements could develop and Israel's security could be threatened once again."

We have to act according to international law, according to humanitarian law, and do everything so that the conflict does not spill into the region," [Tanja Fajon said](https://twitter.com/MZEZ_RS/status/1716364386233725397), expressing concern over the electricity, food, fuel and water shortages faced by the blockaded civilians of the bombarded Gaza Strip.

She noted that these residents need "hundreds of trucks every day" of humanitarian aid. U.N. supplies began to enter the Gaza Strip over the weekend through the Rafah crossing that bridges the enclave with Egypt.

"We strongly condemn any form of terror. We strongly condemn holding hostages and mostly killing of innocent civilians," Fajon said.

EU chief envoy calls for humanitarian pause to hostilities
----------------------------------------------------------

The European Union's top diplomat Josep Borrell on Monday called for a pause in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

"Now the most important thing is for humanitarian support to go into Gaza," Borrell told reporters in Luxembourg, according to Reuters.

"Personally, I think a humanitarian pause is needed in order to allow humanitarian support to come in and be distributed."

The EU is on Monday holding a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, where officials intend to discuss Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, tensions in Armenia and Azerbaijan and "the situation in Israel and in the region, following Hamas' brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel and the events unfolding in Gaza," [the bloc says](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2023/10/23/).

"I cannot anticipate the result of the meeting but it is certainly something which the ministers will have to discuss ... The Secretary-General of the United Nations asked for it very much," Borrell said Monday.

On Sunday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who traveled to Israel to oversee preparations for a humanitarian aid convoy to Gaza at the end of last week, [urged](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1715906818566656201) not to lose sight of the two-state solution to long-arching hostilities between Israeli and Palestinian people.

Earlier on Saturday, Guterres had called for the release of hostages held by Hamas, sustained humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and diplomatic efforts to prevent the spill of the Israel-Hamas conflict into the broader Middle Eastern region.

People should take sides in Israel-Hamas conflict, IDF spokesperson says
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Israeli military spokesperson criticized the recent spread of protests against Israel as uninformed, urging non-participants in the country's conflict with Hamas to take sides on moral grounds.

"I think that people who are out and are protesting against Israel are either uninformed or really filled with hate towards Israel based on things that have nothing to do with what is going on with Gaza now," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus [told ABC Radio Melbourne](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/melbourne-mornings/israel-defense-forces-idf-jonathan-conricus-raf-epstein/103008668) on Sunday night.

Demonstrators have taken to the streets of several Middle Eastern and European countries out of solidarity with the Palestinian civilians of the Gaza Strip, who face severe electricity, medical, food, fuel and water shortages as a result of Israel's retaliatory siege against Palestinian militant group Hamas.

"I don't think that we should be forced to provide sustenance to the same enemy that is firing rockets at our civilians and trying to kill our civilians," Conricus said, referencing Israel's decision to interrupt deliveries of its own supplies to the Gaza Strip within days of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks.

Antisemitic incidents and hate crimes have also picked up in the two weeks since the start of hostilities.

"I actually think that one should take sides. One should take sides and choose, according to your own morals, where you stand," Conricus added. "We are not the aggressor. We didn't start this war ... We are now defending ourselves."

Full Hamas surrender and return of hostages could prevent ground incursion, IDF says
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A full surrender of Palestinian group Hamas and the return of Israeli hostages could end Israel's war in the Gaza Strip and prevent a ground incursion, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus [told ABC Radio Melbourne](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/melbourne-mornings/israel-defense-forces-idf-jonathan-conricus-raf-epstein/103008668) on Sunday night.

"If Hamas were to come out of their hiding places, that they hide underneath the civilian places, which is what they're doing now, return our hostages, all 212 of them, and surrender unconditionally, then the war will end. If they won't, we will probably have to go in and get it done," he said, declining to elaborate if dismantling Hamas or rescuing hostages is the current IDF priority.

"The aim here is to totally dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities. If that can be done from the air, and with standoff measures, with very limited exposure to our troops and less damage on the ground, that would be great," he added.

Israeli Army Spokesperson for International Media, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus.

An Israeli ground incursion into the Gaza Strip has been long anticipated since the IDF instructed civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate southward toward the end of the first week of hostilities. Human rights groups have decried the possibility, pointing to a likely exacerbation of the existing humanitarian crisis in the embattled enclosure. Conricus reiterated that the IDF does not set out to target civilians, while claiming that Hamas uses non-combatants as human shields.

"Once we will bury our dead, we will get busy with Hamas, we will see an end to the Hamas, and then the security situation Israel and also for Gaza will be better," the spokesperson said.

WHO says further medical supplies reached Gaza Strip
----------------------------------------------------

Additional medical supplies from the World Health Organization have entered the Gaza Strip, the organization's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus [said early Monday on social media](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1716277554787627050).

The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean [said this equipment](https://twitter.com/WHOEMRO/status/1716115192298229769) will facilitate surgical interventions for 1,300 people, basic and essential health services for 100,000 patients for a duration of three months, along with treatment for 150,000 chronic disease patients.

Tedros reiterated a call for sustained safe passage for the humanitarian aid convoy and for fuel volumes so sustain both the delivery trucks delivering the assistance and the health facilities of the territories, which have been struggling with electricity shortages.

A first humanitarian truck convoy entered the Gaza Strip over the weekend, through the Rafah crossing that borders the territory by way of Egypt.

In the wake of the deadly terrorist attack on Israel earlier this month and the country's response to it, protestors and bigots have taken to social media to spout hateful rhetoric about Israelis. Now, many American Jews who feel unsafe are putting aside their distaste for guns and gun ownership and are buying weapons to protect themselves, according to [an NBC News report](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/not-safe-anywhere-now-american-jews-are-flocking-gun-training-classes-rcna120602).

There has been a rush of new customers seeking to buy guns and train up how to use them, according to NBC News.

"We've definitely seen a tremendous increase in religious Jewish people, Orthodox people, purchasing firearms," David Kowalsky, owner of Florida Gun Store in Hollywood, who also offers firearms training, told NBC News. "I've seen a surge in interest in individual training as well as group training."

A 20-truck convoy filled with medical supplies, food and water passed through the Rafah Crossing into Gaza on Saturday, with [14 more crossing over](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/second-aid-convoy-egypts-rafah-soon-en-route-gaza-sources-2023-10-22/) on Sunday.

The aid will continue to flow on a daily basis, according to David Satterfield, Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues.

The goal is to have a "continuous flow of assistance moving" to Gaza, said Satterfield on MSNBC's "[Inside with Jen Psaki](https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/watch/-continuous-flow-of-aid-into-gaza-to-begin-monday-u-s-special-envoy-to-middle-east-says-196166213985)."

Satterfield said that Hamas, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, has been warned that if it interferes with the aid there is a chance that it stops.

Israel's potential ground invasion into Gaza could also make it more difficult to deliver aid, he said. There has been concern over Palestinians' access to water as well, and Satterfield said that the U.S. is working with the Israeli government to restore water pipelines.

Satterfield said one of the two key pipelines is restored and they are working on the other.

"The people of Gaza need to be able to live secure lives in Gaza and that requires an end to Hamas' ability to govern, to exploit and to dominate with their terror," said Satterfield.

In addition to aid delivery, Satterfield is working on finding ways for Americans and foreign nationals in Gaza to be able to leave.

President Joe Biden on Sunday had a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the status of Gaza.

Biden and Netanyahu "affirmed that there will now be continued flow" of critical humanitarian assistance into Gaza, the White House said in a statement.

The first wave of humanitarian aid trickled into Gaza on Saturday via 20 trucks that crossed the Rafah border in northern Egypt.

The aid is ready to be deployed according to United Nations World Food Programme Director Cindy McCain, but the trucks have been standing by waiting for clearance to pass through the Rafah crossing.

Civilians in Gaza, caught in the crossfire of the war, have been left without basic necessities like food, water, shelter and medical resources.

While speaking to Netanyahu, Biden also mentioned the ongoing efforts to release American hostages and provide safe passage for U.S. citizens to leave Gaza.
