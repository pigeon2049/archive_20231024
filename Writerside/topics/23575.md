Hamas official Osama Hamdan urged Arab, Islamic countries and the United Nations to try to halt Israel's assault on Gaza, in a press conference held in Beirut on Tuesday.

Hamdan also called on Arab countries to end any normalisation of diplomatic relations with Israel.

The official called for humanitarian aid crossings to be opened, allowing fuel, aid and rubble removal equipment into Gaza.
