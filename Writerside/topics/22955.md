China has removed Li Shangfu from his position as defence minister and state councillor, state broadcaster CCTV said on Tuesday.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's top lawmakers, also voted to remove former foreign minister Qin Gang from his position as state councillor, CCTV said.

The committee appointed Yin Hejun as China's science and technology minister and Lan Foan as finance minister.
