Expectations may be high for an [often-rumored](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862676/nintendo-switch-2-developer-demo-gamescom-rumor) [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878412/nintendo-switch-2-activision-briefing-next-gen-switch), but until Nintendo announces something new, the best option around remains the Switch OLED. Since it’s been such a big year for Nintendo games, there’s really no shame in getting a Switch so late into the console’s lengthy lifecycle, and you can do so with some very good deals.

The [**Nintendo Switch OLED** **model**](https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review) with either [white](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monoprice.com%2Fproduct%3Fp_id%3D44939) or [neon red and blue](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monoprice.com%2Fproduct%3Fp_id%3D44991) Joy-Con controllers is on sale once again for its lowest price of $289.99 ($60 off) at Monoprice. The OLED model is the best Switch for those who spend a lot of their game time in handheld mode since its seven-inch OLED display is a little larger than the standard model and offers much better picture and color quality (yes, even at 720p). It also sports a kickstand that’s actually usable and a dock with an ethernet port. In a nutshell, if you want the best-looking handheld experience for [_Super Mario Bros. Wonder_](https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch) or [_Tears of the Kingdom_](https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch), the OLED is the one you want.

The Nintendo Switch OLED model packs in a bunch of subtle refinements, including a seven-inch OLED display, improved audio performance, and a better kickstand.

[$290 at Monoprice (red and blue)](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monoprice.com%2Fproduct%3Fcjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww%26p_id%3D44991%26AID%3D)[$290 at Monoprice (white)](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monoprice.com%2Fproduct%3Fp_id%3D44939)

This deal may be a little bit niche, but if you want to get into podcasting or livestreaming, there are tons of options out there for a quality microphone that uses the traditional XLR connection. If you go that route, check out the **Elgato Wave XLR**, a USB audio interface that’s dead simple to use and is currently [on sale for $129.99](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Wave-Tap-Mute-Mac/dp/B09738CKKX?th=1&tag=theverge02-20) ($30 off) at Amazon.

Part of what makes the Wave so good is that it can handle popular mics like the Shure SM7B, which is notorious for its low signal, without the need for an additional preamp — you just plug a mic like that in and get solid audio levels without much fuss. It’s part of the reason our very own Tom Warren [uses that exact combo on his desk](https://www.theverge.com/23553867/wfh-work-from-home-desk-chair-display) for calls and his guest spots on _The Vergecast_. The Wave also handles quite easily, with its large physical dial doubling for use as your headphone volume and mix control between your PC and mic.

Elgato’s Wave XLR allows simplified use of advanced and pro-level microphones using an XLR connector, with a big rotary dial for controlling audio levels. The compact audio interface connects to a computer via USB, and it has enough output for even quieter mics like a Shure SM7B without the need for an additional in-line preamp.

### More ways to save this week

*   If you’re looking for a pair of headphones that offer a bit more flair than what you can get from Sony or Bose, the **Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones** have fallen to a new low of $189.99 ($110 off) at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/ckQSKxSSk9b). The ANC headphones offer warm, textured sound and a unique look, not to mention an easy-to-use joystick for controlling playback. They even feature a staggering 45 hours of battery life, which surpasses many of [our top headphone picks](https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones).
*   _**Super Mario Bros. Wonder**_, the first mainline _Mario_ game since 2017, is [on sale for Costco members for $54.99](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/.product.4000224951.html) ($5 off), which is the first discount we’ve seen on the new Nintendo Switch game. It’s a classic side-scroller through and through, but it’s chock-full of clever ideas that make it feel completely fresh. [Read our review](https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch).
*   Wildfire season may be behind us, but you can still pick up the **Coway Airmega 200M** [on sale at Walmart for $129](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCoway-Airmega-200M-Air-Purifier-with-True-HEPA-and-Smart-Mode%2F838527609) ($68 off), an all-time low. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at _The Verge_, I can personally attest to the effectiveness of this entry-level model for smaller rooms.
*   The **Apple Watch Ultra** is [on sale at Woot](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-apple-watch-ultra-1st-gen-1/) with a white Ocean Band for $694.99 ($104 off) — an extra $40 off its usual sale price. The first-gen model is still a great smartwatch despite the recent arrival of the [Ultra 2](https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri), especially since it works with [watchOS 10](https://www.theverge.com/23786155/watchos-10-preview-apple-watch) and packs pretty much all the same hardware minus Apple’s new S9 SiP processor and second-gen ultra wideband chip. [Read our review](https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps).
*   Much like [Microsoft and Nintendo](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/21/23925261/diablo-iv-quake-2-samsung-frame-4k-tv-deal-sale), the [Epic Game Store is running a Halloween sale](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/halloween-sale) through October 31st, slashing up to 80 percent off select PC titles.
