[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) sent invites on Tuesday for a launch event that will be streamed on its website on Oct. 30. The launch will be held at 8 p.m. E.T., which is later than Apple's typical launches, which usually kick off in the afternoon.

New Mac laptops are expected, [according to reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p?srnd=undefined). Apple's iMac, and some of its MacBook laptops have not been updated yet this year. An [event page](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) posted on the Apple website shows a Finder logo animation, which is a Mac app.

Apple's tagline on the invites is "scary fast," which suggests chip news, and is a reference to Halloween.

Apple's current chips are named M2, and it is expected to release faster M3 chips at some point to boost Mac sales, which were down 7% on an annual basis in the June quarter.

Apple held a launch event at its campus for new iPhones and Apple Watch models in September. However, this launch appears to be an online stream with no in-person component.
