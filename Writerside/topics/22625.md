A Paris judge has placed under formal investigation two men suspected of ties to the [Islamist gunman](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/two-swedes-shot-dead-brussels-police-2023-10-16/) who killed two Swedish soccer fans in Brussels this month, the office of France's anti-terror prosecutor said.

The assailant, who identified himself as a member of the Islamic State and claimed responsibility in a video posted online, was shot dead by police the day after the attack.

The assailant's suspected associates both live in the Paris region and face charges of criminal conspiracy, the prosecutor's office said. They were remanded in custody while investigations continue.

Under French law, being put under formal investigation means there is serious or consistent evidence pointing to implication of a suspect in a crime.
