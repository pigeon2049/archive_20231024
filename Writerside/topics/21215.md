U.S. President Joe Biden underscored the need to sustain "a continuous flow" of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, the White House said.

Biden also "welcomed the release of two additional hostages from Gaza earlier today, and reaffirmed his commitment to ongoing efforts to secure the release of all the remaining hostages taken by Hamas," the White House added.

He also updated the prime minister on "U.S. support for Israel and ongoing efforts at regional deterrence, to include new U.S. military deployments," according to the White House.
