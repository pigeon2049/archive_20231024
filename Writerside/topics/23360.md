Jenna Ellis, the right-wing attorney who worked on the Trump 2020 campaign, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a criminal charge in the Georgia election interference case.

Ellis is the latest co-defendant of former President Donald Trump to take a deal with prosecutors, joining Sidney Powell and two others.

The slew of recent plea deals in Atlanta District Attorney Fani Willis' sweeping racketeering case signal a growing threat to Trump, who is fighting criminal charges in four separate cases as he runs for president in 2024.

Ellis, 38, pleaded guilty in Fulton County Superior Court to one count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.
