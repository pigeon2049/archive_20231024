Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Tuesday he is likely to travel to Saudi Arabia soon to discuss investments from the kingdom in his country as part of the "growth acceleration" [plan](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-launches-growth-acceleration-plan-set-invest-350-bln-2023-08-11/) recently launched by his administration.

Lula said in a live broadcast on social media he would probably make a stop in Saudi Arabia on his way to the United Arab Emirates to attend the COP28 global climate meeting next month.

The leftist leader is recovering from hip surgery he underwent late last month and has yet to be cleared by his doctors to travel. He said he was feeling fine.
