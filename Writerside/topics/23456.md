China's leadership has formally dismissed the country's defense minister, Li Shangfu, about two months after [he disappeared](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/18/1200076874/chinas-defense-minister-is-off-the-radar-the-government-isnt-saying-what-happene) from the public eye, Chinese state media reported on Tuesday.

The decision was made after meetings of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, in Beijing.

Qin Gang, China's former foreign minister — who in June had also gone missing from public view — was also stripped of his state councilor position in the same decree on Tuesday. Beijing [replaced Qin with Wang Yi](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/25/1189915255/china-foreign-minister-replace-qin-gang-wang-yi) as its foreign minister in July.

Chinese leaders did not provide explanation for the dismissals, but analysts say they signal turbulence among the top ranks of China's ruling Communist Party, with Li the second minister to be stripped of their titles in recent months.

There is widespread speculation that Li could be under investigation since he began missing official meetings in September and stopped appearing in public, but NPR has not verified this.

The _Financial Times_ [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/d0fa10c5-303c-4129-8283-a147639f70b3) that American officials believe Li is under investigation for corruption. _The Wall Street Journal_ reported Qin [was under investigation](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-ex-foreign-minister-ousted-after-alleged-affair-senior-officials-told-fdff4672) for national security issues over a possible affair.

"This is damaging to \[Chinese leader\] Xi Jinping's personal image, but it will not impact his hold on power," says Deng Yuwen, an independent Chinese political commentator based in the United States.

The speedy removal of two men once widely perceived as close to Xi reflects poorly on Xi's decision-making abilities, says Deng. On the other hand, he says, their dismissal also shows the power concentrated under Xi, and "how the Chinese Communist Party has become even more opaque, because one top leader can appoint or dismiss a person based on his impression from just one conversation."

Li's dismissal comes just weeks after a shake-up at the top of the Chinese military's rocket force, which oversees the country's [growing nuclear arsenal](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1207156597/new-pentagon-report-claims-china-now-has-over-500-operational-nuclear-warheads) and conventional missile stockpile.

Before becoming defense minister, Li headed the military's main weapons procurement and development division. In 2018, Li was sanctioned by the United States for allegedly buying weapons from Russia — [sanctions that became](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/05/1180089440/china-s-defense-chief-rebukes-western-nations-as-u-s-china-tensions-heighten) a major diplomatic roadblock when he was named defense minister earlier this year.
