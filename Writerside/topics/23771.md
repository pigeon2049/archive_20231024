Apple is gearing up for another product launch event on October 30th at 8PM ET / 5PM PT. The company has started sending out invites for everyone to tune in to the event, called “Scary Fast” [on Apple.com](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) and [YouTube](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DctkW3V0Mh-k) Monday night, following rumors Apple is preparing to reveal updates for the Mac lineup.

Apple’s page for the event shows an animation of the Apple logo transforming into the Finder icon, further suggesting that new Macs are on the way. Earlier this week, [_Bloomberg_’s Mark Gurman reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p?srnd=undefined&sref=ExbtjcSG) that Apple [might be planning a surprise “Mac-centered product launch” event](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/22/23927184/apple-m3-imac-13-inch-macbook-pro-rumored-october-announcement).

So far, rumors suggest that Apple could reveal a refreshed 24-inch iMac, along with a new MacBook Pro. As reported by Gurman, Apple’s inventory of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros and the iMac have begun to dry up, which could indicate that we could soon see new models.

Previous rumors hinted the new computers could include Apple’s M3 chip for even faster performance. That speed boost could be what Apple’s hinting at with its “Scary Fast” event name. While Apple typically reveals new iPads in October, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo [suggests that we may not see any updates](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870096/apple-unlikely-release-new-ipad-2023) until next year.

Apple just held its last “Wonderlust” event in September, [when it revealed](https://www.theverge.com/23869728/apple-iphone-15-event-announcements-watch-ultra-airpods-pro-usb-c) the new iPhone 15 lineup, updates to the Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case. The company also showed off a [cheaper USB-C-compatible version](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23919994/apple-pencil-stylus-usb-c-price-updates) of the Apple Pencil last week.

With Apple’s next event less than a week away, we won’t have to wait too long to see what surprises the company is planning.
