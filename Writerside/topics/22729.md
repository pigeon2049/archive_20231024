Russia has long known that the Ukrainian special services are under the "close supervision" of the United States and Britain, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.

He was commenting on a Washington Post report headlined "Ukrainian spies with deep ties to CIA wage shadow war against Russia".

"Our intelligence services have repeatedly spoken about the information we have about the close supervision of Ukrainian intelligence by the intelligence services of the United States and Britain," Peskov said in a regular call with reporters.

"Our special services have known about this for a long time and quite well, we are aware of this."

The Washington Post story, published on Monday, reported that U.S. and British intelligence agencies had provided extensive support to Ukraine's SBU and GUR security services, which it said were responsible for a series of attacks on Russian territory, including the 2022 assassination of Darya Dugina, daughter of a prominent Russian ultra-nationalist.

Russia has previously accused Ukraine of being behind the deaths of Dugina and others, while Kyiv has generally avoided taking responsibility for actions on Russian soil.
