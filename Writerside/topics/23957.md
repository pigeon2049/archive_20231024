[Verizon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/VZ/) stock is up more than 8%, putting it on track for its best daily performance in almost 15 years.

The company beat analyst expectations for both adjusted earnings per share and revenue [for the third quarter](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-strong-3q-results-momentum-raises-free-cash-flow-guidance), based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Verizon posted revenue of $33.34 billion versus the estimated $33.25 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $1.22 as opposed to the $1.18 estimate. Verizon also beat Wall Street's expectations for its postpaid phone net additions, adding 100,000 compared to the 62,000 consensus estimate among analysts polled by StreetAccount.

Verizon also adjusted its 2023 outlook, saying it expects free cash flow to total more than $18 billion, a $1 billion increase from previous guidance.

The last time Verizon had its stock jump like this, the company had not even launched its [4G LTE wireless network](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/vzw/2010/12/pr2010-11-30a) in the United States. The two-day surge came in October 2008 with back-to-back daily increases of 10.1% and 14.6%, respectively.
