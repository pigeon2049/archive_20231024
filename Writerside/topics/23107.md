[The move](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/23/1207946407/gaza-humanitarian-aid-israeli-airstrikes) follows last week's release of two Israeli Americans — a mother and daughter. More than 200 Israeli and foreign hostages remain in Gaza.

*   **NPR's Susan Davis says** some think Republicans are "[exhausted by this public drama](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1198908835:1208168472)" and ready to move on.
*   **Republican strategist Brendan Buck agrees** there is "real fatigue" but tells _Morning Edition_ it's unclear whether [there's enough urgency to break through](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1208165040:1208165041) the stalemate.

**The U.S. is experiencing a steep sell-off** in the bond market, with major implications for the economy and personal pocketbooks.

**Zomorodi speaks with neuroscientist** Peter Strick about the [three-way conversation](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1200611637:1208011975) between our brain, core muscles and adrenal glands in Episode 3 of Body Electric.
