Stock futures rose slightly Monday night as investors focused on the upcoming slate of earnings reports from major tech companies.

[Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@DJ.1/) added 50 points, or 0.1%. [S&P 500 futures](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@SP.1/) and [Nasdaq 100 futures](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@ND.1/) also each climbed 0.2%.

The moves follow a [mixed session](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/22/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) on Wall Street as investors continued watching the [U.S. 10-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y/) yield, which [crossed the closely followed 5%](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/20/what-the-10-year-treasury-yield-crossing-5percent-means-for-you.html) level for the first time since 2007 last week. Rising yields have raised concerns about the state of the broader economy and pressured the stock market in recent weeks.

"Equities are trending sideways to being in a retreat mode given persistent inflation and higher-for-longer interest rates," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management. All the while, "the prospects for recession loom on the horizon."

The [Dow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) and [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) finished Monday's session down about 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively. But the technology-heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) was able to finish up about 0.3%, as investors bought into the sector with important earnings reports ahead.

[Spotify](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SPOT/) reports Tuesday before the bell, alongside [General Motors](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GM/) and [Coca-Cola](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KO/). [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) and [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) are among companies posting results after the market closes.

Investors will also keep an eye on tech later in the week, with [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) reporting Wednesday and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/) on Thursday. [IBM](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IBM/) and [Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/) are among the other well-known tech names offering quarterly results later in the week.

About 30% of S&P 500 companies are slated to report this week, the latest leg of an earnings season that has so far been better than Wall Street expected. About 17% of S&P 500 companies have already reported earnings, and three-quarters of them have posted earnings surpassing analysts' expectations, according to FactSet.

Elsewhere, traders will watch for economic data coming Tuesday morning about the services and manufacturing sectors.

The broader market is approaching an earnings growth inflection, according to Citi
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citi thinks the S&P 500 is on the cusp of an earnings growth inflection, as the market continues to be weighed down by longer-term concerns related to the broader economic environment.

"There is no doubt that 2024 recession risk remains a U.S. equity market overhang," analyst Scott Chronert said in a recent note. "Our view continues to emphasize that earnings risk may be less than typical relative to prior recessions. Further, recessions usually lead to interest rate relief. This can set up for valuation support."

Current estimates still point to flat growth expectations for the third quarter compared to the same period last year, Chronert said.

The analyst remains constructive on the "fundamental setup" for the S&P 500 headed into 2024, however, saying that even modest earnings beats will lift the market out of a mild earnings recession.

He noted that earnings per share growth in the broader market has been negative for three consecutive quarters, but said that only a modest level of upside surprise is needed to push third-quarter EPS growth into positive territory compared to the previous comparable quarter. If that happens, it would push third-quarter year-over-year growth to roughly 3% and fourth-quarter growth to near 10%, he said.
