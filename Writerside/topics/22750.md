Abstract:

Google's .ing domain launch is just about a week away, and excluding those that appear to belong to Google, seven .ing domain names have already been registered.

A few weeks ago, Google announced its plan to launch the .ing domain in late October. Currently, some companies have already secured domain names with their trademarks in the upcoming .ing top-level domain (TLD). According to industry experts, these registered domain names have been acquired in advance using hack-like tactics to secure potentially valuable domains, thus avoiding the need to pay seven-figure amounts in the future. It's clear that the .ing domain is generating significant interest.

With Google's .ing domain launch just about a week away, there have already been reports of some domain hacks showing up in the .ing zone file. Excluding those that appear to belong to Google, there are seven identified so far:

\- adapt.ing

\- design.ing

\- draw.ing

\- dumpl.ing

\- edit.ing

\- giv.ing

\- sign.ing

None of them currently resolve to web servers, and the Whois information is of little use other than confirming the registration dates within the .ing sunrise period.

Both edit.ing and sign.ing have name servers owned by Adobe, which may indicate who registered these domains.

To secure a domain name during the sunrise period, you don't necessarily need to have a famous brand; you only need to have a trademark recognized by the ICANN-approved Trademark Clearinghouse.

The trademark string can "cross the dot," which might explain the cases of dumpl.ing and giv.ing.

Obtaining these potentially valuable generic domain hacks is particularly crucial for .ing, as Google has set exorbitantly high fees for its Early Access Period (EAP) after the sunrise period, starting on October 31. As initially reported by Domain Name Wire, the EAP retail price starts at $1.1 million.
