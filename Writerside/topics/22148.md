Israel's Military Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday that the military was "ready and determined" for the next stage in the war and was awaiting political instruction.

He said Israel was learning from U.S. experience in the Middle East but "our war is on our borders, not thousands of miles from Israel," adding that he was expecting weeks of fighting ahead.

Hagari said Egypt was playing a key role in negotiations for the release of hostages from Gaza, which he said was a top priority for Israel.
