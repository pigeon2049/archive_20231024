LONDON — [Barclays](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BARC-GB/) on Tuesday reported a net profit of £1.27 billion ($1.56 billion) for the third quarter, slightly ahead of expectations as strong results in its consumer and credit card businesses compensated for weakening investment bank revenues.

Analysts polled by Reuters had produced a consensus forecast of £1.18 billion, down from £1.33 billion in the second quarter.

The [British lender warned in July](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/barclays-earnings-result-q2-2023-.html) that it expected to earn less interest in its U.K division.
