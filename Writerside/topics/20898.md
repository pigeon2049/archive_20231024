Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado held an overwhelming lead in the vote count on Monday evening for the South American country's opposition presidential primary with 92.56% support, according to opposition officials.

Nearly 65% of ballot boxes have been counted, they added.

Machado declared victory overnight after an [initial count](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelans-vote-opposition-primary-clouded-by-uncertainty-2023-10-22/) of about a fourth of the ballots cast in the Sunday contest showed she had won by a similar margin.
